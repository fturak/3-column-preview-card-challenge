## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first project using Flexbox and I learnt a lot about using it. I am especially proud of the descripition container div. I came up with it to make fluid and aligned button repositioning to the responsiveness of the cards. In the prior solution it worked but the different sizes of paragraphs reduced aesthetics and cohesion of the buttons and their positioning.

```css
  .description-container{
      /*acts as a container for desc text to make responsivity more fluid and aligned between buttons*/
      height: 245px;
  }
```
