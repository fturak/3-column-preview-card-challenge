## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![]

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first project using Flexbox and I learnt a lot about using it. I am especially proud of the descripition container div. I came up with it to make fluid and aligned button repositioning to the responsiveness of the cards. In the prior solution it worked but the different sizes of paragraphs reduced aesthetics and cohesion of the buttons and their positioning.

```css
  .description-container{
      /*acts as a container for desc text to make responsivity more fluid and aligned between buttons*/
      height: 245px;
  }
```
